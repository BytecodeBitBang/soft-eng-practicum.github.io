These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course sections
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc]
and [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] in the Spring 2020 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an
external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction
throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the GGC App Factory event on April
23rd, 2020, which was held online instead of during the regular GGC
CREATE Symposium because of the COVID-19 restrictions.
