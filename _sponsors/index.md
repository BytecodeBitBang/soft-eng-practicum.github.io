#### Beyond Funding—Sponsorship is Mentorship, Innovation, and Impact

Our sponsors provide more than just project ideas—they offer students a window into professional environments, guide product development, and empower hands-on learning.

Whether it's a tech startup mentoring a team of developers, or a research lab needing custom-built tools, these partnerships help turn classroom knowledge into career-ready capability.
