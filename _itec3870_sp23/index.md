  description: "The software development website will have enhanced styling and usability by improving its appearance. In addition, the website will be updated to provide a better accounting of faculty, students, and technologies involved. Lists will be added that enable users to click and access more detailed information. For example, clicking on a student's name will display a list of all the projects they have worked on. These improvements will enhance the user experience and make the site more user-friendly."

  tech: [ python, flask, jupyter-dash ]
  screencast-youtube: 01RToD-YbK4
  members: "Kelvin Zetino, Jacob Franscoviak, Bradley Nguyen"
  client: "Sairam Tangirala and Tae Song Lee"
  description: "Our latest development, SAUCE 2.0, has transformed the already impressive Raspberry Pi and Python-based project into a powerful Android Web application, which now boasts an easy-to-use mobile platform, complete with a well-designed dashboard and intuitive user interface. The application allows users to collect data from various sensors such as cameras, temperature, and humidity, and store it seamlessly in the cloud. Our innovative approach includes interactive sliders for data viewing, providing users with an unparalleled on-the-go experience. We have leveraged Flask and Dash packages to create a functional, intuitive dashboard that uses a pioneering machine learning algorithm to detect "cracks" in images and tag high-probability images for easy analysis. The new mobile-tablet application is designed to provide new and exciting user interface experiences for the physics department and NASA projects. SAUCE 2.0 is the ideal solution for those seeking a modern, user-friendly approach to structural analysis."

These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course section
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the Spring 2023
semester. Each project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC
professor or an external client who provided the idea, requirements,
and direction throughout the semester. Final products were
demonstrated and tested by other students and faculty at the App
Factory demonstration in person and online sessions as part of the GGC
CREATE Symposium event on April 25th and 27th, 2023.
