The application allows users to collect data from various sensors such as cameras, temperature, and humidity, and store it seamlessly in the cloud. Our innovative approach includes interactive sliders for data viewing, providing users with an unparalleled on-the-go experience. We have leveraged Flask and Dash packages to create a functional, intuitive dashboard that uses a pioneering machine learning algorithm to detect "cracks" in images and tag high-probability images for easy analysis. The new mobile-tablet application is designed to provide new and exciting user interface experiences for the physics department and NASA projects. SAUCE 2.0 is the ideal solution for those seeking a modern, user-friendly approach to structural analysis."

  description: "The Grizzly Hacks student organization has been developing a web application that will act as a one-stop shop for any information regarding their activities or hackathons. Significant progress has been made on this by previous groups, but when passed off to the Hackers much of this needed to be brought in line with modern requirements. To accomplish this we were tasked with bringing technologies in line with the latest versions, improving administration over hackathon events, and introducing a new section that would allow Grizzly Hacks to inform members about other events that may occur throughout the semester. By doing this the Grizzly Hacks website will become an essential tool for anyone interested in the organization or any of the happenings surrounding them."

These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course section
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the Spring 2023
semester. Each project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC
professor or an external client who provided the idea, requirements,
and direction throughout the semester. Final products were
demonstrated and tested by other students and faculty at the App
Factory demonstration in person and online sessions as part of the GGC
CREATE Symposium event on April 25th and 27th, 2023.
