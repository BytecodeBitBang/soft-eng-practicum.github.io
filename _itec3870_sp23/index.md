  description: "The software development website will have enhanced styling and usability by improving its appearance. In addition, the website will be updated to provide a better accounting of faculty, students, and technologies involved. Lists will be added that enable users to click and access more detailed information. For example, clicking on a student's name will display a list of all the projects they have worked on. These improvements will enhance the user experience and make the site more user-friendly."

These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course section
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the Spring 2023
semester. Each project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC
professor or an external client who provided the idea, requirements,
and direction throughout the semester. Final products were
demonstrated and tested by other students and faculty at the App
Factory demonstration in person and online sessions as part of the GGC
CREATE Symposium event on April 25th and 27th, 2023.
