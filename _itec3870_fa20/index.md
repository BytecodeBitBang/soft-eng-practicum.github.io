The goal for this program is to help GGC students enrolled in ENG 1101 and 1102 develop persuasive, academic writing skills by flagging potential false positive grammar checks and offering corrective feedback. Ultimately, the user should be able to either take or leave the program’s feedback and/ or corrections based upon their knowledge of grammatical rules in the English language and the rules of academic writing."

  description: "For our Software Dev II project, our team is working on the Roster Sniper website. The purpose of this site is to assist students in finding and getting a spot in classes that they want and that best suit their needs, and the end goal is to help remove some of the stress that students have when picking courses. Traditionally, students would have to constantly check back on the course registration website if a class they want or need has any open spots. However, with Roster Sniper, students can now simply select classes that to “watch,” and they will be notified as soon as a spot opens up in that section."

  description: "For our Software Dev II project, our group is developing a mobile application for the Lawrenceville Cooperative Ministry. They are a community food bank ministry that provides food for people and families in need. The application’s main purpose is to provide a way for the Coop’s customers to “Check-in” before they come to pick up their free food. It will allow the user to provide enough information to the Coop, like name, phone number, and food preferences. This will allow the Coop to get the care package ready before the customer gets on site. It will also provide information about the Coop values and mission, as well as information regarding volunteering. Additionally, the app will provide information to allow people to contact the Coop and get directions to get to the facility."

These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course sections
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc]
and [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] in the Fall 2020 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an
external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction
throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the GGC App Factory event during the
GGC CREATE Symposium on November 12th and 13th, 2020, which was held
online for the first time because of the COVID-19 concerns.
