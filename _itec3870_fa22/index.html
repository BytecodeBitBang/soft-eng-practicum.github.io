These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc] students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course section taught by [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] in the Fall 2022 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the GGC App Factory event during the GGC CREATE Symposium on November 10th (on campus) and on November 11th (online), 2022.
