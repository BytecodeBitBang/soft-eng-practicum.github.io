This application was designed for Dr. Jon Rees who needs this application to be able to perform daily tasks at his current employment. Due to the nature of the app, it can also be of use to many people around the world as it is a utility application. With Lipid-Lator, one is able to calculate the abbreviation, formula, and monoisotopic molar mass of over 97 million different combinations of lipids. All of the data is completely offline so there is no need for any internet connection at all. This application can and will help many chemists easily and rapidly find the information they need."

The application must be user friendly, because our main audience will be students who are taking Dr. Stackpole and Dr. Erickson’s calculus section. 
The application must also record time, Velocity x/y/z, pitch, roll, Yaw, Altitude.
Each data collection will be unique to each student who use the application, and will be used to make their very own calculus problems.
Dr. Stackpole hopes that this will change his student’s view on calculus, and hope they will enjoy the subject."

  client-url: http://www.ggc.edu/about-ggc/directory/shelby-shuler
  description: "SmartVid is an educational platform designed to enable professors to create a more interactive learning experience by uploading videos to be viewed by their active classes. The benefit of SmartVid is that the videos created by the professors will be tailored toward the classes they teach, providing a personalized resource where students can access the material their professors are teaching. Additionally, professors will be able to monitor the activity of their students via progress bars showing how much of the video (and which part) the students have viewed. This will be coupled with periodically introduced quizzes as the video is viewed, designed by the professor(s). A professor would then be able to decide what action would be taken if the student fails the quiz (IE: the student must re-watch the video, the quiz must be immediately retaken, etc.)."

These projects were developed during the ITEC 3870 Software
Development 2 course taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the
Fall 2017 semester by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc] students. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor who
provided the idea, requirements, and direction throughout the
semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested by other
students and faculty at the GGC CREATE symposium. Click on
titles to see their demo sites.
