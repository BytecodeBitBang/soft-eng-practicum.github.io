This application was designed for Dr. Jon Rees who needs this application to be able to perform daily tasks at his current employment. Due to the nature of the app, it can also be of use to many people around the world as it is a utility application. With Lipid-Lator, one is able to calculate the abbreviation, formula, and monoisotopic molar mass of over 97 million different combinations of lipids. All of the data is completely offline so there is no need for any internet connection at all. This application can and will help many chemists easily and rapidly find the information they need."

These projects were developed during the ITEC 3870 Software
Development 2 course taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the
Fall 2017 semester by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc] students. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor who
provided the idea, requirements, and direction throughout the
semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested by other
students and faculty at the GGC CREATE symposium. Click on
