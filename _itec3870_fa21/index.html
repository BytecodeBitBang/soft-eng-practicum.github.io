  description: "For our Software Dev II project, our team is working on the Roster Sniper website. The purpose of this site is to assist students in finding and getting a spot in classes that they want and that best suit their needs, and the end goal is to help remove some of the stress that students have when picking courses. Traditionally, students would have to constantly check back on the course registration website if a class they want or need has any open spots. However, with Roster Sniper, students can now simply select classes that to “watch,” and they will be notified as soon as a spot opens up in that section."

In the scheduler, professors can set preferences on classes that are setup by administrators. The website application attempts to provide an intuitive interface for professors to resolve course conflicts, set preferences on courses, and set available hours. For administrators, the interface should allow them to easily see conflicted courses, courses with no teaching professor, and download/upload this data into an excel spreadsheet for easy conversion."

These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc] students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course section taught by [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] in the Fall 2021 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the GGC App Factory event during the GGC CREATE Symposium on November 18th, 2021, which was held on campus for the first time after COVID-19 quarantine period.
