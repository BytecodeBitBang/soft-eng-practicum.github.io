  description: "The InternApp is a web application that helps juniors and seniors majoring in biology and information technology apply for internships and research opportunities. Students can access pertinent information for available internships, upload their resumes, fill out important forms, and send their applications to the biology and ITEC programs' respective internship coordinators all through the InternApp. Additionally, the InternApp gives internship coordinators a way to access student applications and forms in one place, helping them to organize, process, and expedite internship applications for GGC students."

These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course sections
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc]
and [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] in the Fall 2019 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an
external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction
throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the GGC CREATE symposium on Nov
21th, 2019. Click on titles to see their demo sites.

The apps were tested by participants at the symposium, who submitted
their scores for each app in the categories of *completeness*,
*usefulness*, and *appearance*. Scores were summed and combined to
find the following best teams and their products:

1.    *Polaris*, with "STaRS Judging App"
2.    *Vegan't*, with "GGC Maps"
3.    *ShadowFax*, with "Shutter Plug"
