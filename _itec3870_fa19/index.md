  description: "Grizzly Parking is an app that helps people find a parking spot on GGC Campus. The app allows users to log in and create their own accounts. Each account can view the lots via color indicators showing which lots are more available. When the user parks it will update the system and the color indicator in their respective lot.  User Authentication, Forgot Password and the Parking Lots were all integrated through Google’s Firebase Platform.  This mobile app was [originally written](../itec3870_fa18/#Grizzly+Parking) in an Ionic Framework, but we decided to abandon that codebase and rewrite it in React Native.  This ended up being a good choice for us even though some experienced errors throughout the semester."

These projects were developed by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students during the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 course sections
taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc]
and [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] in the Fall 2019 semester. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor or an
external client who provided the idea, requirements, and direction
throughout the semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested
by other students and faculty at the GGC CREATE symposium on Nov
21th, 2019. Click on titles to see their demo sites.

The apps were tested by participants at the symposium, who submitted
their scores for each app in the categories of *completeness*,
*usefulness*, and *appearance*. Scores were summed and combined to
find the following best teams and their products:

1.    *Polaris*, with "STaRS Judging App"
2.    *Vegan't*, with "GGC Maps"
3.    *ShadowFax*, with "Shutter Plug"
