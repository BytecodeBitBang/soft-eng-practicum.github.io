These projects were developed during the ITEC 3870 Software
Development 2 course taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the
Spring 2017 semester by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc] students. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor who
provided the idea, requirements, and direction throughout the
semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested by other
students and faculty at the GGC CREATE symposium. Click on
titles to see their demo sites.
