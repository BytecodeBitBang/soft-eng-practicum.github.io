TODO: add links, disclaimed GGC did not do anything.

<h2 class="project-title">Briefly</h2>

GGC Maps is a student-created web application to improve navigation on
the Georgia Gwinnett College campus that started in Fall 2016. Its
main feature is that it's very light, loads quickly, supposed to even
work offline using the Persistent Web Application (PWA) standard, and
allows finding exact location of rooms inside buildings.

One of the biggest success of this project was its student
traction. Every semester since its inception one more teams have been
working on improving it and adding new features because it was so
useful to the campus community. As a result, it has gained hundreds of
users across the campus through word of mouth despite not being an
officially endorsed or promoted application. It is currently being
maintained by two of our software development concentration
students/alumni [Mike Deiters](http://deiters.me) and David
Rivera-Rocha.

<h2 class="project-title">Features</h2>

Major features of the project include:

- Hand-drawn zoomable, high-quality SVG vector format maps of campus
  and every building and floor
- Finding rooms in all campus buildings based on room number or name 
- Auto-completion (broken as of Fall 2018)
- Listing of news items and locations from school calendar
- Safety toggle that shows an overlay of items such as fire
  extinguishers, severe weather shelters, and defibrillators
- Parking legend for whole campus
- Persistent web application feature that can work offline using
  mobile browser service worker architecture (broken as of Fall 2018)

<h2 class="project-title">History of the project</h2>

Chronological progression:

<h3 class="project-title">Fall 2016 (base application framework with all maps)</h3>

In the ITEC 3870 Software Development 2 (SD2) course of the Fall 2016
semester, the instructor Cengiz Gunay recruited arts professor
Catherine Moore to supervise class projects. Prof Moore thus proposed
the original concept of an interactive campus map to the developer
students as something direly needed on campus. Dr Gunay assigned Prof
Moore two student teams, who were in competition with each other. Each
team would work secretly from the other, and at the end of the
semester, they will compete to provide the best campus map solution.

The **first competing team**
([link to final demo]({{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_fa16/#Campus+Maps+1)),
composed of Christopher "Cody" Cates, Adam Printz, Lance Toornman, and
Eric Kim, maintained their assigned title and developed a campus map
application titled "Campus Map 1". They used the AngularJS framework
to design a mobile-friendly web application that reused existing JPEG
campus map images found on the school website. This project also
successfully demostrated automated unit testing using the Karma,
Jasmine, and Protractor toolchain on the TravisCI continuous
integration service. Their main and unique contribution was the
ability to list campus events that were read from a OneDrive document
editable by faculty. Even though this functionality was complete, it
required using a specific account, which made it difficult to be
adopted widely.

<img class="logo-thumb" title="The Fall 2016 GGC Maps flyer" src="{{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_fa16/images/thumb-flyer-GGM.png"/></a>

The **second competing team**
([link to final demo]({{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_fa16/#GGM)), composed
of Michael Deiters, Narith Seang, and Aston Tsou, created the
application titled Gwinnett Grizzly Maps (GGM). This was a web app was
written from scratch in HTML/CSS/Javascript without using any
libraries or frameworks. It was designed as a single-page application
that required no back-end functionality (e.g., no database or
server-side execution). This allowed the project to be easily hosted
on a static content server, such as Github Pages. We later referred to
the structure of the program affectionately as "Mike Deiters
Framework" as he was the architect. It worked fast and was compatible
with both desktop and mobile browsers. It contained a campus map with
buildings and parking lots, and individual maps for each floor of
every building. The real impressive part of this application was that
the team painstakingly hand-drawn all the campus buildings room by
room such that zoomable and completely interactive maps at the room
level were available. This allowed clicking on individual rooms,
highlighting them, and many other future potentials.

As overall looks and performance of the second GGM team was superior,
they won the competition and their project became available for future
student teams to develop further.

<h3 class="project-title">Spring 2017 (offline PWA feature) </h3>

<a id="lightgallery" href="{{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_sp17/images/flyer-ggcmaps.png">
<img class="logo-thumb" title="The Fall 2016 GGC Maps flyer" src="{{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_sp17/images/thumb-flyer-ggcmaps.png"/></a>

The second semester of GGC Maps development continued in the SD2
course
([link to final demo]({{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_sp17/#GGCmaps)) with
a student team composed of David Rivera-Rocha, Josh Gerth, Carlos
Pacheco-Perez, and Margaret "Maggie" Muse. The major new functionality
added to the application was the Persistent Web Application (PWA)
feature by David that allowed the app to act like a native mobile app
and allow installing on the home page of mobile devices. The PWA
technique uses the _service worker_ feature of modern browsers of
keeping persistent data and running outside of the browser in a single
instance. This feature also brings offline functionality as cached
data can be read from the service worker. David also established a
collaboration with the BrowserStack company to allow extensive
cross-platform testing of the application and make it much more
compatible with different platforms and browsers. The team also
achieved many bugfixes in this iteration of the development, with some
newly added features that included:

- features section in the help menu
- developer documentation section on Github
- contributor license for future development
- new logo

At the end of this iteration, David became one of the permanent
maintainers of the project, joining Mike Deiters.

<h3 class="project-title">Fall 2017 (event listing, safety mode, predictive search, added parking lots and buildings) </h3>

The third semester of development had another competition between two
teams. However, this time the teams decided not to compete, but to
collaborate with each other. This was despite the instructor Dr
Gunay's attempts to create a cut-throat competition environment with a
winner and loser. Instead, the two teams planned their proposed
features for the semester to be separate from each other, such that
they can both be incorporated into the final product. This created an
efficient develpment environment with a lot of new features ended up
getting added to GGC Maps.

<img class="logo-thumb" title="flyer" src="{{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_fa17/images/thumb-flyer-ggcmaps-adventuras-new.jpg"/></a>

The first team, **Adventuras**,
([link to final demo]({{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_fa17/#GGC+Maps+v3a))
was composed of Bryan Yeap, Matt Soucy, Robert Westervelt, and Nilaja Williams. This team contributed most during this semester. They were responsible for features as:

- Event listing: A new menu item allowed listing events read from the
  college calendar website and link to their campus
  locations. Provides event information related to events held on GGC
  campus. Event list changes depending on the building being
  accessed. Provides events up to 2 weeks ahead of current date.
- Safety mode: All building maps were updated to show an toggling
  overlay that showed locations of safety equipment such as AEDs, Fire
  Extinguishers, Fire Alarms, Trauma Kits, and Safety Shelters.
- Functional Service Worker: Checks all cache versions in the users
  browser and deletes any old versions. Additional files for cache.
- Updated Building Legend: Add locations and building labels. Turns
  off if parking legend is on, vice versa.
- Predictive search: Auto-complete functionality to help type names of
  rooms without having to guess exact spelling (e.g. Chick-Fil-A).

<img class="logo-thumb" title="flyer" src="{{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_fa17/images/thumb-flyer-ggcmaps-navbenders.jpg"/></a>

The second team, **NavBenders**,
([link to final demo]({{ site.baseurl }}itec3870_fa17/#GGC+Maps+v3b))
was composed of Maryam Najiarani, Richard A Williams Jr, and Joseph
Pelletier. Some of the significant achievement of this team was:

- Making the rooms of the 3000 dormitory buildings
searchable by drawing their maps from school plans. 
- An updated look to all parking lots with accurate labels such as
handicap and staff/faculty parking. 
- New updated legend for all parking lots.

Effort from project maintainers Mike Deiters and David Rivera-Rocha
must be mentioned because they worked with the two teams throughout
the semester and helped them merge their additions together into the
final single repository.
