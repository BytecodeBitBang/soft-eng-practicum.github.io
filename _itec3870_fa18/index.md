These projects were developed during the ITEC 3870 Software
Development 2 course sections taught
by [Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu][doloc-ggc] and [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc]
in the Fall 2018 semester by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc]
students. Each project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC
professor or an external person who provided the idea, requirements,
and direction throughout the semester. Final products were
demonstrated and tested by other students and faculty at
the [GGC CREATE symposium][create] on November 29th. Click on titles
to see their demo sites.

Based on the votes of the guests testing the apps at the symposium,
here are the winning teams:

1.    Free Radicals
2.    Tech Titans
3.    MatchMakers
